## Project Description

By analyzing criminal records in the past 12 years, this project aims to study the relationship between crime category and potentially correlated factors. Deriving from this goal, we investigated the features that characterize crime categories, such as hour, day of the week, street address, and relative distance from nearby Starbucks shops.

## Directory and File Organization

*Note: Please run skeleton.R to fetch data, set up directories, and load supporting functions before moving on. Please avoid running the entire script all at once. Running skeleton.R command by command will help grasp the overall structure and process of this project. It would also be helpful to briefly explore the code scripts run by the source commands in skeleton.R.

All files relevant to this project are in the following directories:

1. code: contains all scripts
     
2. rawdata: contains crime.csv (past criminal records),
            StarbucksAddresses.csv (addresses of Starbucks shops in San                        Francisco), metadata (summary of test.csv)
                
3. data: contains processed and cleaned data files
     
4. resources: empty

5. report: contains our project report
     
6. images: emtpy

## Project Exploration Instructions

1. Head to rawdata subdirectory and briefly explore the .csv raw data files. 

2. Check out the data subdirectory to verify that the processed data files have been saved there. 

(Optional) If have not done so, skim through code scripts in the code subdirectory. We recommend the following order: preprocess.R, getMinDistanceFromStarbucks.R, utils.R, utils2.R, plotMaps.R, plotCrimeMinStarbucksDist.R, ................

3. Open projReport.pdf in the report subdirectory to read our report.
